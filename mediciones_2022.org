#+title: EXPERIMENTS LAB ACTIVITY 2022
#+STARTUP: latexpreview

* Description:
Projection of experiments fo perform in the LAB in 2022. Schedule to design after meeting.

 
1. *Air Table* 
   * _Moving wall (Jamming)_.- Two stages: a) Identical disks (just as a test); b) Bi-disperse system
     (to 3D print particles).
   * _Static 4 walls (Convection)_.- Vary air intensity so that we can track evolution of convection. I
     would pick 2 or 3 reference particle densities. One at low density, other at moderate density
     and a last one at higher density.
     
2. *Thin layer* 
   * _Arrest phase -to- gas phase transition_.- Pick standard values of frequency and layer height, say
     50 Hz and h=1.750 \( \sigma) \).
   * _Thermal memory.-_ Design protoclol for detection and measurement of fast transients.
